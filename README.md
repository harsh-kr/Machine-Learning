# Machine-Learning
ðŸ¤– :bar_chart: This repository explores the various concepts and algorithms that comprise the field of Machine Learning.<br>
Machine learning is the scientific study of algorithms and statistical models that computer systems use in order to perform a specific task effectively without using explicit instructions, relying on patterns and inference instead. It is seen as a subset of artificial intelligence.<br><br>
Broadly, there are 3 types of Machine Learning Algorithms..<br>
### 1) Supervised Learning - 
This algorithm consist of a target / outcome variable (or dependent variable) which is to be predicted from a given set of predictors (independent variables). Using these set of variables, we generate a function that map inputs to desired outputs. The training process continues until the model achieves a desired level of accuracy on the training data. Examples of Supervised Learning: Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN, Logistic Regression etc.<br>

### 2) Unsupervised Learning - 
In this algorithm, we do not have any target or outcome variable to predict / estimate.  It is used for clustering population in different groups, which is widely used for segmenting customers in different groups for specific intervention. Examples of Unsupervised Learning: Apriori algorithm, K-means.<br>

### 3) Reinforcement Learning - 
Using this algorithm, the machine is trained to make specific decisions. It works this way: the machine is exposed to an environment where it trains itself continually using trial and error. This machine learns from past experience and tries to capture the best possible knowledge to make accurate business decisions. Example of Reinforcement Learning: Markov Decision Process.<br>
